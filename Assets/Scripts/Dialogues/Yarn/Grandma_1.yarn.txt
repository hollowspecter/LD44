Hello my dear! May I say that your hair looks really fabulous! 
[[Thank you very much! Your hair looks awesome too!|compliment]]
[[Oh, thank you! I had it done at the Mall. Really great woman there.|recommendation]]
[[Thank you, I did it myself! Hairdressers never understand what you want anyway, right?|critique]]

My grandson did it. Did you know, he is a hairdresser himself? And a really good one! You should totally see him!

[[Oh, that is awesome! I bet he is the best! It is such a sophisticated job.|confirmation]]
[[Sounds good! Where is the place where I can find him?|question]]
