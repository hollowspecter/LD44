That's what I wanted to hear! Alright:
I have bird, cat and dog food. I even licked off the saliva. 
Also a half eaten sandwich with tuna and a cup of melted ice cream. I'm telling you, as good as new!
I know there is this sign on the door to not eat in here, so meet me at Furry Park at midnight. See ya!

And when I'm in the water is super silent around me...
I feel so safe...
[[That's nice, I guess?|no]]
