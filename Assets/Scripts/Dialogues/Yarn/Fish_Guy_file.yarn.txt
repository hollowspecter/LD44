<<Fish Guy>> But mine is the fish of a prince. He is so special. He wants me to conquer the world for him, so he can be Fish-King over the world. Or queen. Sometimes he feels like a queen.  But anyway, you ever thought about being a slaughtering commander? 
<<Self>> [[Actually, that sounds like a great idea! When do you start?|greatidea]]
<<Self>> [[No, thank you. But good luck.|goodluck]]

<<Fish Guy>> My fish once lived with a prince and now he wants me to conquer the world. And it is really hard to find an army. You ever thought about being a slaughtering commander?
