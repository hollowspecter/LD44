*typing sound, flashlight*
Bruh...? My bae just posted this v salty thing about me.
She met that basic bitch that doesn't fit into our epic fam at all!
So I suggested to ghost her. And now she acts all cray! As if I am the cheesy one!
[[Maybe it is not a bad thing your group gets a new member. You could try to get to know the new girl. Maybe you are just afraid to lose her.|advice]]
[[Seriously? That is so random. I know TFW when you're low key FOMO. But you can't let yourself be trolled by that. You are a v dank guy so do something beautiful to show her!|comfort]]

I mean, adulting often seems high-key to be the best solution. And she is my hunty but she can be drama AF. 
Haha, she just posted a picture of her cat sleeping. Awesome! I am also a swol cat! Slayed it! 
You think there is a hidden meaning behind cats?
[[Of course, they are low key the secret rulers of the world.|rulers]]
[[I mean, they are pets and normal animals... Can there be something hidden about that?|normal]]
[[Sure! They are so extra and amazing!|extra]]

Yaas, right?! She should appreciate the trill. That new girl should just swerve! I mean who does she thinks she is?
Basic bitch she is! Haha, my bae just posted a picture of her cat sleeping. Ugh, I hate when she has fun without me.
Selfie time!
