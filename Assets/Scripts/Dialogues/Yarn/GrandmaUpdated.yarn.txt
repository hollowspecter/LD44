Hello my dear! Can you help me?
May I say that your hair looks really fabulous!
[[Thank you very much! Your hair looks awesome too!|compliment]]
[[Oh, thank you! I had it done at the Mall. Really great woman there.|recommendation]]
[[Thank you, I did it myself! Hairdressers never understand what you want anyway, right?|critique]]

I'm the old one here!
Are you getting deaf with old age?
[[I apologize!|upset]]
<<else>>
Oh, that is so nice of you!
My grandson did it. Did you know, he is a hairdresser himself? And a really good one! You should totally see him!
[[I thought you said my hair was fabulous? Why do I need to see another hairdresser?|irritation]]
[[Oh, that is awesome! I bet he is the best! It is such a sophisticated job.|confirmation]]
[[Sounds good! Where is the place where I can find him?|question]]

Oh, my dear. If you don't know that yourself...
You know there is a mirror in the bathroom. My poor, poor, dear. Have you ever tried a marriage agency?

Anyway... Have a nice day, dear. Try to see the good things in life

That is so right my dear! It is an art form not valued enough!
He is a real creative genius! The Curls and the Bob and the Plaits! He even invented a new bald!

<<Self>> [[Oh, right, ofcourse! I heard of the new bald. Is that the new cut you got yourself?|confusion]]
<<Self>> [[Your son really is godlike creature. He should totally get the nobelprize for hairdressers. Have a real nice day!|saving]]

At the Mall?? Once my neighbour went there and she had NO hair when she came out!
You should try my grandson instead!
