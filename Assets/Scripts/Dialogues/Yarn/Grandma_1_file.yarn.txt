<<Grandma>> Oh my dear? At the mall? You know the people that work there are not as competent as you might think. 
<<Grandma>> Now that I look at your hair, you should really have gone to my grandson. He is just the best hairdresser you could ever want!
<<Grandma>> Look, he did my hair too! Isn't it just amazing?
<<Self>> [[Oh.. really? But sounds... good... I guess. I mean, amazing haircut you have! So where's the place I can find him?|question]]
<<Self>> [[I thought you said my hair was fabulous? And why do I need to see your grandson?|irritation]]
<<Self>> [[Oh, your hair truly is awesome! I should totally see him! I bet he is the best! It is such a sophisticated job.|confirmation]]

<<Grandma>> That is not what I meant. At all! My wonderful and beautiful grandson is the best hairdresser you could ever hope to meet! and you could really use a new haircut!
<<Self>> [[Oh, I didn't know that! I mean what do I know about hairdressers when I never go to them? If I had gone to your grandson, I would propably love hairdressers!|saving]]
<<Self>> [[I am sure he does a great job, but I still like to do my hair myself. And what do you even mean, I could use a new haircut? You just made me a compliment about it?|irritation]]
