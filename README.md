### Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life!
You work for the man, the machine, the money, you know; you work so you can live.
Except you are at your desk 23h a day - the extra hour is your performance daily review - so keep up with the queue, the customers and their boring *alive* conversations, and don't fuck up the change or their Yhellp review is gonna be as bad as your next day.

Teller Me More is a time management game, where you struggle with the daily task of handling a bank counter - make accounts, give and receive the *right* amount of money while keeping your highly annoying and varied clients entertained.
Not an easy task when you are the last human teller on this downtown busy bank - downright animalistic working conditions.
